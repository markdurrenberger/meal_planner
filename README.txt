Current plan:
[X] - add 12-15 meals for a starting point
[ ] - meal_recommender() function - get this working
[ ] - meal_details() function - create function that prints out a formatted version of meal's instructions

Notes on next steps/things to add.
- change/make adjustments to meals details
- view meals: will need grouping methods to keep from a giant list, hundreds long
	something like: 1 - view all meals, 2 - view by protein source, 3 - view by cuisine, 4 - view by tags
